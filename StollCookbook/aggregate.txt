Julie Stoll

-1/2 c. melted butter
-About 6 tbsp. minute tapioca
-12 tart apples, peeled, cored, and thinly sliced (MacIntosh, Wealthy)
-1 c. sugar
-Cinnamon
-1 c. raisins (optional)

KEEP THE ROOM WARM.

Make and stretch strudel dough according to directions. Brush the surface of the dough with some of the melted butter. Add the apples, sprinkle with sugar, cinnamon and then tapioca. Fold edges over around the strudel where the apples are. Roll and place on a buttered baking sheet. Brush top of roll with remaining butter. Prick with fork. Bake at 400 degrees for 10 minutes then reduce heat to 350 degrees and bake 30-35 minutes longer or until brown. Turn edges.

#Strudel Dough:

-3 c. sifted flour
-2 eggs, room temp.
-1/2 tsp. salt
-3 tbsp. melted butter
-2/3 c. warm water

Use ceramic bowl.
Sift flour onto a pastry board. Make a well in center and add eggs, salt and butter. Add water slowly and work mixture into a soft dough. Knead dough until it becomes elastic and leaves the board clean. Or, pick up dough and throw it on the board one hundred times. Form dough into a smooth ball. Cover with a warm bowl and let stand about one hour.
Spread a clena cloth over a large table and secure with thumbtacks in several spots so that it will be easier to work on. Dust the whole cloth lightly with flour. Place dough in the middle of the cloth and roll out into a large oblong. Reach under the dough with palms up and stretch the dough until it is transparent. With kitchen shears cut off the thick edges.
Cover about 2/3 of dough with the filling. The dough will roll easily by simple lifting the cloth high in the air and pulling gently at the same time. With the last roll, deposit the strudel in a buttered baking pan. Brush with melted butter. Bake at 400 degrees for 10 minutes.

Homemade Noodles
Potpourri
Donna
182

-8 eggs
-3 c. flour (approx.)
-1 tsp. salt
-2 tbsp. oil

Mix eggs, salt and oil with wire whip. Add about 1 cup flour and stir with fork. Add another 1/2 cup and mix some more. Add less and less at a time until its dry enough to roll out on floured board. If the noodle becomes too sticky to roll out just keep adding a little flour on top and bottom of noodle ball so you can continue to roll out the noodle real thin.
When the noodle seems dry enoug hto roll up loosely without sticking together, do so, cut thin strips of noodle with sharp knife.
Cook noodles in boiling water maybe 5 minutes, just enough to rince off the flour. Drain in sieve and put in soup broth to finish cooking.

Betty's Grundy Noodles
Potpourri
Robin
182

-1/8 tsp. salt
-9 eggs
-2 1/2 - 3 c. flour

Mix together to form dough - I use a whisk. Then add enough milk so the batter isn't dry, but not soupy.
Then either put in large measuring pitcher or on a plate and with a knife cut little pieces of dough into boiling water. I use a pitcher and as I slowly pour a little I am cutting it off the edge of the pitcher. Cook about 2-3 minutes and pour into colander. Rinse with cold water.
Melt butter (at least 1 stick), garlic powder, Accent and season salt to tast. Takes quite a bit of the garlic powder and seasoning salt. Add noodles to frying pan and rewarm slowly - they tend to get hard if they cook too fast.
